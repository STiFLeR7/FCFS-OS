# Operating Systems Scheduling Algorithms

Welcome to the repository for Operating Systems Scheduling Algorithms implemented in Python. This repository contains various scheduling algorithms used in operating systems to manage processes. The aim is to provide clear and efficient implementations of these algorithms for educational purposes.

## Introduction

Scheduling is a critical part of an operating system's functionality, managing the execution of processes by the CPU. This repository provides Python implementations of several key scheduling algorithms, offering a practical resource for students and enthusiasts to understand and experiment with these concepts.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
3. **Priority Scheduling**
4. **Round Robin (RR)**
5. **Longest Job First (LJF)**

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own Python file. To run an algorithm, simply execute the corresponding Python file.
